jsDiffbot
=========

From the Diffbot.com site: Diffbot's Product API turns any commerce site into an on-demand product database. 

This is a JavaScript interface to their API.

The source already includes a token, please don't abuse it, if you do, it will just get blocked and then there's no fun 
for anyone until you get your own. So play nice.

I really want to encourage you to go to the Diffbot.com site and check things out, it's pretty cool and there's lots that
you can do with this API.
